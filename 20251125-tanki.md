<pre><b>Closure of Tanki-related projects</b> - <i>Nov 25 2025</i>
<hr>
Today's the day of temporaily closing all of my Tanki-projects and putting it on archive.
I've been losing my interest with changing my enthusiasm over old Tanki community because I'm aware that
I've been spending my free time over working these projects.
I'm on 10th grade, and doing some homework and adding some fixes to unnecessary projects every single day has been
hard for me and I need to stop before anything bad happens.
I may come back in 2 years, or more, or less: shit depends.

<i>Thanks everyone, it's been fun.</i>
